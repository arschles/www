summary: The road forward to stay healthy and have a life

"Paving any road is hard, you have to throw some rocks out of the way first." - Me, just now.

After hitting lows and digging out, I feel like I have a good handle on how to live sustainably and healthily. But I also know that it'll be a lifelong commitment to myself. And for the first time ever I'm encouraged to enter that commitment.

## The rules

The first rock to throw out of the way is taming those rules that I talked about in the last post

something about carrying around medicine doses in my car and backpack

something else about making it second nature about monitoring anxiety and sleep

something about saying no when it's unhealthy. health first
