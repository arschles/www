I've spent most of my life as a professional programmer using a potpurri of Apple laptops and desktops. The first machine I used to do paid development work with was a MacBook in 2004. I've cycled through a few Mac Minis and MacBooks since then, and I'm typing this on yet another Mac Mini.

I don't love Mac OS or Apple hardware per se, but I'm just so _used_ to the Apple ecosystem. I'm talking about everything from knowing the ins and outs of an iPhone, all the way down to details like the many ways to use the `cmd` key on the terminal.

## Making a leap to the Microsoft world

All that being said, I like a challenge at work. And for me, there's no bigger challenge than tossing my comfortable workflow down the drain and learning a new way to work.

A few years ago, I started hearing that Windows and Microsoft hardware is a true contender as a development machine. I'm a Microsoft employee, so I figured my curiousity combined with that was a sign to go for it. I decided to get a [Surface Go](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/surface/business/surface-go) and started to really give Windows a try.

The hardware is good, but just not for me because I can barely see the screen or type on the keyboard. I'm getting old...

A few months ago I started hooking it up to a proper monitor, keyboard and mouse to see what Windows is like on the desktop. It took me a few days to get used to fundamental differences -- like having a start menu and no `/Applications` folder -- but I started feeling comfortable within a few days.

## WSL 2

Even then, I couldn't get most of my development work done. I'm too used to and reliant on a Unix-like environment and switching my coding tools would be too big a hit on my productivity to justify.

I had to reach for [WSL 2](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/wsl2-index) to get the Unix environment I needed. This is the lynchpin of my every day workflow. Once I had WSL 2 up and running, I was ready to go!

I can write and debug code the exact same way as I did on the Mac, I can run containers, use the same [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) [plugins](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/VSCode), and it just feels comfortable.

I got my feet wet with the Surface Go, and now I'm in the deep end. I've built a computer, installed Windows & WSL 2 on it, and am beginning to use it in my everyday work.

After I get a few odds and ends like USB extension cables, I'll be ready to make it my primary development machine.
