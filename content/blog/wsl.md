Way back when I worked for Microsoft on the team that built [Entourage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Entourage) - then part of the Office for Mac suite. The work we did there was adapting Windows-specific concepts and code to the Mac platform. At the time, MacOS was evolving very quickly. This was in the early OS X days and a lot of the work we did was converting old [Carbon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_%28API%29) API calls to the "new" [Objective-C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objective-C) [Cocoa framework](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cocoa_(API)).
