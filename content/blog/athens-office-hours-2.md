Athenians! First of all, thanks to everyone who came to the [first office hours](/blog/athens-office-hours/). I think it was a success, and we're going to keep going.

# When

Like last time, we're going to vote for the time that works best for the most people. 

>**Please vote for the time that works for you at this link: https://doodle.com/poll/tiypx72hs6ttmezq.**

# What

Last time, we went through a few things. First, we looked at the [configuration system](https://docs.gomods.io/configuration/) internals. Then, we started to look at how the [storage system](https://docs.gomods.io/configuration/storage/) code uses the configuration to set up the appropriate storage backend.

So, this time we're going to start where we left off! We started talking about how the [MongoDB storage backend](https://docs.gomods.io/configuration/storage/#mongo) works, so we're going to look at that part of the codebase in more detail.

# Other Logistics

We'll be doing the meeting on the same [Zoom](https://zoom.com) room as last time. Here's the link: https://arschles.com/zoom.

Finally, as always, **absolutely everybody is welcome**. Anyone is free to join, listen, ask questions, or otherwise participate. I will always do my best to include anyone who wants to be involved with the Athens community in any way.

Hope to see you there!
