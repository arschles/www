Search for ["what is Kubernetes?"](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=what+is+kubernetes&t=brave&ia=web) and you'll find videos, documentation, articles, and more, explaining, predictably, what Kubernetes is. I'm going to boil all of that down into two sentences:

>Kubernetes is an operating system for your cluster of computers. Like any OS, you get a syscall API and build abstractions from there.

Everything else you read about this technology will go into extensive detail about these APIs, how to secure your cluster, running various workloads, and much more. If you're new to Kubernetes, take the time to let those two sentences sink in before you move on, especially if you build applications.

If you're a webapp developer trying to deploy to Kubernetes, remember how you're building your web app. You're most likely using some kind of HTTP router rather than parsing HTTP headers yourself, you're using some kind of ORM or database driver, a JSON parser/marshaler, and probably more abstractions.

## A Day in the Life of a Webapp Developer

I used the term "webapp developer" above, and it's not precise; that's on purpose. I'm not out to define what this group of people does, I'm out to assert what tasks _shouldn't have to do_ while building their app. There are unsurprisingly a bucket of things in this category of things, and one of those things are learning all the low level "syscall" APIs that Kubernetes provides.

Kubernetes is a platform for web applications, not a user experience to give to webapp developers.

## A Better UX

We don't have a state of the art developer focused user experienced (UX) for deploying production apps to Kubernetes. Many cloud providers, however, have built great UX-es on top of their proprietary technology; we can bring them into our community:

- Deploys happen when you push to GitHub or another VCS host
- A CLI is available to deploy the same code to production
- It's easy to connect your code to other cloud services (databases, etc...)
- You can opt-in to more advanced features like testing out new deployments, more complex networking and storage, and more

Unsurprisingly, Kubernetes has the foundational technologies that can build these higher level features; organizations using Kubernetes internally have built them.
