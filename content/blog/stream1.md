Two days ago, I decided to [start streaming](https://twitter.com/arschles/status/1240036551687434240). I had a lot of fun just talking through my dev setup and showing how to make a small contribution to [Athens](https://github.com/gomods/athens). It felt like doing a [Go in 5 Minutes](https://github.com/arschles/go-in-5-minutes) screencast, but I could be a lot looser and more informal. I felt ok making mistakes and saying "I don't know".

This wasn't me _teaching_ a single topic, it felt like sharing.

**I'm going to stream again tomorrow**. I'm always behind on triaging issues in the Athens project, so I'll do a bit of that.

Details of the stream:

- I'll stream on Twitch at [twitch.tv/arschles](https://www.twitch.tv/arschles)
- It will be at 10 am US Pacific Daylight Time. Use [time.is](https://time.is/compare/10am_20_Mar_2020_in_Portland,_Oregon) to convert that to your time zone

Hope to see you there!
