COVID-19 has really quickly turned out lives upside down, and we're truly living in unprecedented times. As tech folks, many of us are working from home now. As a WFH-er for over 5 years now, welcome!

I've had a lot of fellow WFHer colleagues and friends over the years who've had the same experience as me:

- Right at the beginning, you're in work mode 24/7. You're getting so much done!
- Then you burn out and work less. You feel guilty because you think you're not working at all. Everyone says this is what happens when people work from home
- You notice you're still doing good work despite your feelings. Time to ramp up the hours!
- Oh wait, you've gone down that road before. It didn't work out well
- Then, you start learning how to be sustainable working from home

For some, this takes a few months. For me, it took a few years. Don't be like me. Here are some hard-earned rules that I've picked up over time to help keep me sustainable. Try them for yourself!

>I was talking to some of my fellow [Gophers](https://blog.golang.org/gopher) on the [Gophers Slack](https://invite.slack.golangbridge.org/) about the new work setup a lot of folks have. In that discussion, I verbalized these rules for the very first time. What follows is a better-written version of what I wrote in that chat.

- Do what you need to separate your workspace from your "lifespace". If you can do so, work in a separate physical space. This might be putting your workspace in a spare bedroom or basement (basement office represent!)If you don't have that kind of extra space, separate your workspace out in your mind. One way to do this is to set an alarm on your phone to signal that work has started. It can help you put your brain into work mode in the morning. Then, set up another alarm to signal the end of the day. Make it non-negotiable. That means when the alarm sounds, the laptop gets shut, no slack, no IDE, no “just one more thing before I go to dinner”. **This is hard to do. You won’t get it right most of the time for a while. That’s ok. Keep trying**
- Set up an office space. Following on from the previous bullet... clean up, get hardware you need if you want/can, or just work on the dining room table. You can buy things like monitors/speakers, small things like laptop stands, mice, and keyboards. Or you can just put your laptop on books so you don’t mess up your neck. Any little improvement to make you more comfortable and you’re winning
- If you were previously in an office, you were around people. Even if you hated it, don't let that environment go away overnight. Do video calls with _people you like_. This could be FaceTiming with family or doing a hangout with friends or colleagues. I do a "no expectations" Zoom chat with my work mates every few days. We just come to hang out and talk about whatever comes up. Just make sure you're not always communicating by typing, see someone's face, and talk to them with your voice
- Get up, walk, and stretch your body. Going outside and putting fresh air into your lungs is best, but that depends on whether that's allowed in your locale. Just walking around your domicile for *five minutes* works wonders. The main two reasons for this:
  - Get more blood flowing to your legs. This is *critical*. Study after study shows that, tl;dr, your body is not designed to sit all day.
  - Let your shoulders and upper back relax. Especially if you're on a laptop that is below your natural eye level
- Look at something far away for 20-30 seconds, every 10 minutes, at least. You'll exercise a lot of the muscles in your eyes. That's proven to help prevent various kinds of degeneration, even long term. You won't break your flow doing this. I can almost guarantee that it'll actually help you keep your flow
