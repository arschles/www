Hey Gophers! If you don't know what Athens is, you should totally [go check it out](https://docs.gomods.io). The quick overview is that it's a proxy server for Go modules, and an interesting open source project with a community full of supportive Go programmers that help, encourage, and welcome contributions from anyone interested (we make that a priority!). 

>**I'm starting an Athens office hours session.**
>
>**Absolutely anyone interested in Athens is welcome to join.**
>
>**The first session will be this Thursday or Friday (June 27 or 28).**

>**Please vote on the time(s) that work for you at [this link](https://doodle.com/poll/bwy8tiaxh3ehb5g6).**

Whether you're a seasoned Go programmer, a newcomer interested in getting involved with a Go open source project, or even someone brand new to open source -- we have contributors who fall into all these categories and more -- I want to make the project even more accessible for you.

That's why I'm starting this Athens office hours session. This session is a place for learning and discussing different pieces of the codebase and architecture of Athens. And _anyone_ who is part or the project or interested in the project can join. 

# Details

The office hours will be held on a [Zoom](https://zoom.com) video chat at this link: https://arschles.com/zoom. Here's the format of the first office hours:

- I'll choose a section of the codebase to start looking at
- I'll introduce the achitecture of this section at a high level
- Anyone attending can ask questions, at any time
- We'll navigate the codebase as the questions lead us (not limited to the area I chose!)
- I am not the “expert”. I happen to know a little bit about a lot of the codebase, but hopefully others will attend who have a lot more in-depth knowledge about individual pieces. There’s power in numbers!

I intend to make these office hours recurring. The format might change in future office hours sessions if needed, but the only thing that won't change is that **absolutely everybody is welcome**.
