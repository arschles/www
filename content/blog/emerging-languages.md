My history with programming languages and frameworks is approximately this:

- I started my career writing PHP 3
- Then I wrote C/C++ ([Boost](https://www.boost.org/) forever!)
- Then I discovered Java, Scala, Objective-C, Perl, Python, Clojure and Haskell all at once
- Then I ditched it all for Go

Oh, and throw some javascript in there.

I've been pretty focused on Go for a while and was missing learning new languages. [Brian Ketelsen](https://twitter.com/bketelsen) introduced me to [Nim](https://nim-lang.org/) and then I wanted more. So between my curiousity and his endless list of cool new tech, I've been checking out a few languages. 

Here they are, along with my summaries of them:

- [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/) - Ruby with less monkey patching but more macros
- [Rust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rust_(programming_language)) - C++ with more bullets to shoot yourself in the foot with, but less foot
- [Crystal](https://crystal-lang.org/) - Compile Ruby to machine code. And now you can use all the cores!
- [Ballerina](https://ballerina.io/) - Kinda like [Metaparticle](https://metaparticle.io/), except it's a language
- [Swift](https://swift.org/) - Objective C and Scala had a baby, and you can compile it on the LLVM

Ok, I know it seems like I'm pretty sarcastic about all these languages, but I'm legitimately excited about all of these! I'm gonna play around with them for a while until I find something real to build.
