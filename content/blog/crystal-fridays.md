If you've been following my [Twitch](https://twitch.com/arschles) you've probably seen that I'm doing "Crystal Fridays" live streams for the past few weeks.

>Catch me every Friday at 10am US Pacific time [on Twitch](https://twitch.tv/arschles)

## What is Crystal Fridays?
The premise is simple. I live code writing apps in [Crystal](https://crystal-lang.org). Currently I'm working on [cprox](https://github.com/arschles/cprox) - a simple URL shortener that's implemented with a [little persistent key-value store](https://github.com/CodeSteak/Nuummite).

>If you don't know about Crystal, it's a language that looks like Ruby but it's _compiled_. I'm really enjoying it and I encourage you to check it out if you have a spare moment.

## Join me!
If you're interested in participating in Crystal Fridays, come watch me live code:

- **When: 10am US Pacific Time**
- **Where: [twitch.tv/arschles](https://twitch.tv/arschles)**
    - Tip: you can use [time.is/compare](https://time.is/compare) to find out what time that is in your time zone

## Recordings

I record every Crystal Fridays stream and upload it to [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLd5PS0DQ17GBxMQ78nmowkAxilgS_LrNB), so you can catch up if you miss one.

Videos should be up shortly after each stream.
