Hi Gophers, it's your friendly co-chair of the GopherCon program committee!

For the past [two](./gc-cfp-2020) [years](./gophercon-2019-cfp-omg/), I've written about the GopherCon [call for proposals (CFP)](https://www.papercall.io/gophercon-2021) when it opened. Like last year, this year's conference is a bit unique because of the Coronavirus pandemic, but the CFP process is the same as always.

We're looking for great proposals that will become great talks - even if you can't make it to San Diego physically. We're still looking for first time speakers - all else being equal, we'll prefer a first-time speaker over an experienced one. We're still planning to put on an engaging, educational, and exceptional conference.

## What We Do

Before I go into details on what you need to put in your proposal, I think it's important for you to know how we review your proposal. We've always been transparent about this, but it's useful to have a reminder. Here's how it works:

- You submit your proposal(s) to [PaperCall](https://www.papercall.io/gophercon-2021).
- We have a group of experienced reviewers that does initial [double-blind](https://www.wordnik.com/words/double-blind) reviews. These reviews are done based on criteria below. _Every proposal submitted before the CFP closes gets reviewed the same way during this step._
- After the CFP closes, we shortlist proposals with high average scores and choose proposals for the final program from this short list
  - We have to de-anonymize proposals during this step, so that we can choose the best lineup of talks for our audience and so that we can contact you if your proposal is accepted, so this step is not completely double-blind
- If your proposal is accepted, we work with you from that point until the day the conference starts to help you be successful.
  - We communicate frequently and have a group of experienced speakers and mentors available to help you with your slides, watch dress rehearsals of your talk, give you tips, and more.

## How (and What) You Should Submit

So, given that's how we work, what should you keep in mind while submitting?

### Make Your Talk Relevant

GopherCon is a **Go conference** and people pay to go to it (this year you can watch it on a live stream for free by the way!) because they want to learn more about Go. That means your proposal needs to be about Go and interesting to those people. Make sure you tell us, in your proposal, how your talk relates to Go. If you're unsure how to do that, you can be explicit: "This talk relates to Go because ...." is fine!

Also remember that main theater talks need to be relevant to everyone at the conference. If you're looking to go into detail on a topic, propose a tutorial talk.

### Make Your Proposal Clear

This one might sound obvious, but it's easy to forget that the review committee and chairs only know what you want to talk about by reading your proposal. For most of the review process they don't even know who you are.

Make sure that everything you're thinking is clearly written down in your proposal. If you have to write more about what you plan to talk about, do it. Proposals are rejected because they're unclear, but I've never seen a proposal rejected specifically because it was too long.

### Correctness

We want to accept proposals where the speaker has knowledge on what they propose to speak about. We don't need you to be an expert by any means, but we want you to at least be speaking from experience. Remember that experience can mean a lot of things, including:

- What it was like for you to learn something
- How you overcame a challenge at work by using technology `$TECHNOLOGY`
- What it was like fixing a bug in module `$MODULE`

One more thing here - remember again that the only way we know whether you can deliver a talk from experience or expertise is from your proposal. For the majority of the time while we're evaluating your proposal, we don't know who you are or anything about you.

### Achievability

Main theater talks are 25 minutes long and tutorial sessions are 45 minutes long. In either case, those timeframes are a _lot_ shorter than they sound. You need to show us that you've thought about how long your talk will take and you know how you'll fit your content into the timeframe you've chosen. The best way to do this is to include an outline of your talk and include rough timing. It shows you've thought about timing and it also greatly improves the clarity of your proposal.

>We've rejected talks we liked but weren't sure if the proposer knew how they were going to fit their talk into the time alloted.

### Impact

**This is the piece that's missing in the vast majority of rejected proposals**. We look for talks that will teach the audience something new, so we need you to tell us what you plan to teach. Don't assume that it's obvious because it likely isnt.

If you're not sure how to do that in your proposal, write this: "The audience will walk away with `$THING_YOU_PLAN_TO_TEACH`."

## More Reading

There's a lot of literature out there on how to submit a great proposal. We've added links at the bottom of [the CFP page](https://www.papercall.io/gophercon-2021), but this year, one of my co-chair peers, Kris Brandow, is writing a detailed blog series on this topic. Please check out [post 1](https://blog.gopheracademy.com/storytelling-on-stage-the-basics/) and [post 2](https://blog.gopheracademy.com/storytelling-on-stage-storytelling/).

## Conclusion

We get anywhere from 180-300 proposals in less than a month, and multiple people double-blind review each and every one. With that in mind, here are some important tips to keep in mind:

- Don't assume that something was implicit, especially if it's detailed or intricate. It may be to a coworker but it's likely not to a reviewer with limited time and who doesn't know who wrote the proposal.
- We like detailed proposals. When in doubt, elaborate on an important point in your proposal. Be explicit!
- Proposals that don't state their impact on the audience have a low chance of success.
- You don't need to be an expert in the topic you submit. You do need to have experience with it. Make sure to clearly tell us what that experience is!

And with that, I wish you good luck with the CFP and I hope to see you on stage soon!
