`people > tech` all the time, every time. All the great communities I've worked with prioritize making everyone feel comfortable. I've focused over the past five years on building communities in the same style. Here are some of the notable ones:

- [The Athens Project](https://github.com/gomods/athens)
- [The Go Study Groups](https://gophersource.com/study-group)
- [Go in 5 Minutes](https://goin5minutes.com)
