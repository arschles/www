# About Me

Hi there! I'm a [Gopher](https://golang.org), [Kubernaut](https://kubernetes.io) and functional programming nerd.

I also work at Microsoft as a [**C**loud **D**eveloper **A**dvocate](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/advocates/aaron-schlesinger) (CDA), where I focus there on Kubernetes / Containers, Go and emerging languages.

### What is it You'd Say You Do Here?

Here's what I'm up to these days:

- I created and produce [Go in 5 Minutes](https://goin5minutes.com)
- I started and run the North America chapter of the [Go Study Groups](https://gophersource.com/study-group)
- I'm a core maintainer of [The Athens Project](https://github.com/gomods/athens)
- I'm an emeritus chair of the Kubernetes 
[SIG-Service-Catalog](https://svc-cat.io/)

I've also spent the past 5 years teaching (primarily Go) and building open source communities. I do this a few different ways, but mostly with Go in 5 Minutes.

### Speaking

I currently speak about Go, DevOps, and Kubernetes. I've spoken at industry leading conferences like:

- OSCON
- KubeCon
- Open Source Summit
- GopherCon
- CodeMotion

I've also spoken on Scala / Java, Javascript, C++ design patterns, and technology transformation in large organizations.

### Writing

I write articles here, and you'll see some of me around the web as well:

- [Medium](https://medium.com/@arschles)
- The [Athens Project Blog](https://medium.com/project-athens)
- The [Go in 5 Minutes blog](https://medium.com/go-in-5-minutes)
- The [Go Study Groups Blog](https://medium.com/gostudygroup).

### My History

In my 15+ years in software engineering, I've worked in lots of different roles. Here are some of them:

- I helped build a video aggregation system for capturing and publishing university lectures. We attached Mac Minis with webcams to carts and rolled them in and out of lecture halls.
- I was a C++ / Cocoa engineer at Microsoft on the Office for Mac team. We figured out how to run (and ship!) lots of the code from Windows Office on a Mac
- I wrote [Newman](https://github.com/stackmob/newman), which was the first REST client library for Scala. It takes prior art from [Scalaz](https://github.com/scalaz/scalaz) and other "hardcore" functional programming concepts and presents them as a slick API. I wrote about it [here](https://www.paypal-engineering.com/2014/02/13/hello-newman-a-rest-client-for-scala/)
- I helped build a "third party code execution platform" on top of the JVM. It was essentially containers as a service, but just for JVM languages. We used the JVM to constrain resources and provide jails.
