I've worked on projects all around the Go ecosystem. These days, I focus a lot of my time on [Athens](https://docs.gomods.io) and modern Go dependency management.

I used to spend a lot of time leading the Kubernetes [SIG-Service-Catalog](https://github.com/kubernetes-incubator/service-catalog) group, and I've stepped away into an emeritus role there.

I produce two online shows that are freely available to anyone in the world:

**[Go in 5 Minutes](https://gifm.dev)** is a series of short screencasts with tutorials on Go.

**[Crystal Fridays]()** is a weekly live-coding session where I write apps in [Crystal](https://crystal-lang.org). Watch live at [twitch.tv/arschles](https://twitch.tv/arschles). See recordings [on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLd5PS0DQ17GBxMQ78nmowkAxilgS_LrNB)

I also sell a few educational products:

- **[The Ultimate Guide to Web Apps in Go](https://gumroad.com/l/hgHhj)** (subscription)
- Go in 5 Minutes extended screencasts:
    - [All about the Go html/template package](https://gum.co/gifm-x-14)
    - [Dive deep into Go concurrency](https://gum.co/gifm-x-15)
