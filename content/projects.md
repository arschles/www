I'm a big Go fanboy and I've worked on projects all around the Go ecosystem. These days, I focus a lot of my time on [Athens](https://docs.gomods.io) and modern Go dependency management.

I've spent a lot of time leading the Kubernetes [SIG-Service-Catalog](https://github.com/kubernetes-incubator/service-catalog) group, and I've stepped away into an emeritus role there. I now do a lot of work as a Kubernetes user rather than builder.

I also love trying out new programming languages like [Crystal](https://crystal-lang.org/), [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/) and [Ballerina](https://ballerina.io/). But I still compare everything to Go.

Finally, I love studying functional programming theory, but I'm no good at it at all.
