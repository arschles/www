I currently speak about Go, DevOps, and Kubernetes. I've spoken at industry leading conferences like:

- OSCON
- KubeCon
- Open Source Summit
- GopherCon
- CodeMotion

I've also spoken on Scala / Java, Javascript, C++ design patterns, and technology transformation in large organizations.

# Bio and Headshot

Below is my up-to-date bio and headshot. If you're a conference organizer, you may include these verbatim in your program.

## Bio

Aaron is a developer advocate at Microsoft Azure and a core maintainer of the [Athens](https://docs.gomods.io) Project. Before Athens, he was a core maintainer and chair of the Kubernetes [SIG-Service-Catalog](https://github.com/kubernetes-incubator/service-catalog) and a contributor to various other projects in the Kubernetes community.

He has almost 15 years of software engineering experience ranging from frontend design to distributed data systems. He discovered Go around 2013 and hasn’t looked back. He lives in San Mateo, CA where he and his wife love to run up and down mountains together.

# Teaching & Community

I've spent the past 5 years teaching (primarily Go) and building open source communities, most recently:

- [Go in 5 Minutes](https://goin5minutes.com) - a screencast series with the most concise, practical Go screencasts on the web
- [Go Study Groups](https://gophersource.com/study-group) - a casual meeting, similar to an unconference, for Gophers to chat about Go and meet other Gophers in the community
