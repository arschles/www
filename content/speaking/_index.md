Below is my up-to-date bio and headshot. If you're a conference organizer, you may include these verbatim in your program.

Here are my [previous talks](/talks) if you want to see me in action.

## Bio

Aaron is a developer advocate at Microsoft Azure and a core maintainer of the [Athens](https://docs.gomods.io) Project. Before Athens, he was a core maintainer and chair of the Kubernetes [SIG-Service-Catalog](https://github.com/kubernetes-incubator/service-catalog) and a contributor to various other projects in the Kubernetes community.

He has 15+ years of software engineering experience ranging from frontend design to distributed data systems. He discovered Go around 2013 and Kubernetes in 2015 and hasnâ€™t looked back. He lives in Portland, OR where he and his wife love to run up and down mountains together.
