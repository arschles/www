I'm a software engineer at Microsoft interested in cloud technologies, distributed computing and programming languages. I'm currently working on making [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/) (commonly referred to as "WASM") run very well in the cloud. Beyond WASM, some of the technologies I currently use most are [Rust](https://rust-lang.org), [Go](https://golang.org), and [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io).

I have [spoken at conferences](/speaking) extensively and have [taught](/teaching) a wide variety of topics to various audiences.

## Projects

I am, or have been, involved with several major projects as well, including the following:

- **The KEDA HTTP Addon** - I conceived and built this project to bring the ability to autoscale HTTP services on Kubernetes using KEDA. You can find out more about it at [github.com/kedacore/http-add-on](https://github.com/kedacore/http-add-on). I have stepped away from everyday work on this project to focus more on WASM technologies.
- **Athens** - I'm a co-creator and core maintainer of the [Athens](http://docs.gomods.io) project. Athens is a server for Go dependency management that you can host and run yourself.
- **Go in 5 Minutes** - I produce **[Go in 5 Minutes](https://gifm.dev)**, a series of short screencasts with tutorials on Go.
- **Modules in 5 Minutes** - I wrote a quick reference for how [modules](https://blog.golang.org/using-go-modules) work in Go: [Modules in 5 Minutes](/modules5)
- **GopherCon** - I'm a chair of [Gophercon](https://gophercon.com), which is the largest [Go](https://golang.org) conference in the world.
- **Kubernetes SIG-Service-Catalog** - I am an emeritus chair of the Kubernetes [SIG-Service-Catalog](https://svc-cat.io/) group.

## My History

In my 15+ years in software engineering, I've worked in lots of different roles. Here are some of the thing I've done in them:

- I built a video aggregation system for capturing and publishing university lectures. We attached Mac Minis with webcams to carts and rolled them in and out of lecture halls.
- I was a C++ / Cocoa engineer at Microsoft on the Office for Mac team. We figured out how to run (and ship!) lots of the code from Windows Office on a Mac. I worked on the [Entourage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Entourage) product, which evolved into Outlook today
- I built a distributed log aggregation system with [Scribe](https://engineering.fb.com/data-infrastructure/scribe/). It transferred log data from edge locations and app servers, normalized it, and forwarded it to a data warehouse
- I wrote Newman, the first REST client library for Scala. It takes prior art from [Scalaz](https://github.com/scalaz/scalaz) and other functional programming concepts and presents them as a consistent API. The original codebase disappeared, but I forked it from a backup on [my GitHub organization](https://github.com/arschles/newman)
- I helped build an untrusted code execution platform on top of the JVM. It was similar to a modern "containers as a service" product, but just for JVM languages. We used several JVM features to constrain resources and provide jails
- I wrote one of the first Java APIs in the Scala language
- I designed an HTTP-based streaming RPC protocol and write a functional (as in functional programming) server implementation using the Twitter [Finagle](https://github.com/twitter/finagle) core primitives.
