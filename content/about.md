Hi there! I'm a [Gopher](https://golang.org), [Kubernaut](https://kubernetes.io) and functional programming nerd.

I also work at Microsoft as a [**C**loud **D**eveloper **A**dvocate](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/advocates/aaron-schlesinger) (CDA), where I focus there on Kubernetes / Containers, Go and emerging languages. I also [speak](/speaking) and [teach](/teaching) a wide variety of topics.

I do several live coding sessions each week:

### Let's Go Live Coding

I do a weekly live-coding session with [Jennifer](https://jennifer.dev). We're going from nothing to mastering Go together.

- **Watch it live every Monday at 11am US Pacific Time at [twitch.tv/arschles](https://twitch.tv/arschles)**
- You can check out all of the recordings [on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLd5PS0DQ17GCdvijjkLObfahEZzsJCAxO)
- See notes from old streams and plans for new streams [on GitHub](https://github.com/osscda/lets-go-stream)

### Cloud Native Wednesdays

I do a weekly live-coding session with [Jennifer](https://jennifer.dev). We go in depth into [Cloud Native](https://cncf.io) technologies each week.

- **Watch it live every Wednesday at 1:30pm US Pacific Time at [twitch.tv/arschles](https://twitch.tv/arschles)**
- You can check out all of the recordings [on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLd5PS0DQ17GDaRQOXIk_ZhFnAfGe-UUZU)
- See notes from old streams and plans for new streams [on GitHub](https://github.com/osscda/cloud-native-stream)


### Crystal Fridays

I produce **Crystal Fridays**, a weekly live-coding session where I write apps in [Crystal](https://crystal-lang.org).

- **Watch it live every Friday at 10am US Pacific Time at [twitch.tv/arschles](https://twitch.tv/arschles)**
- Recordings are [on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLd5PS0DQ17GBxMQ78nmowkAxilgS_LrNB)

And I am/was involved with some projects as well:

- **Athens** - I'm a co-creator and core maintainer of the [Athens](http://docs.gomods.io) project. Athens is a server for Go dependency management that you can host and run yourself.
- **Go in 5 Minutes** - I produce **[Go in 5 Minutes](https://gifm.dev)**, a series of short screencasts with tutorials on Go.
- **Modules in 5 Minutes** - I wrote a quick reference for how [modules](https://blog.golang.org/using-go-modules) work in Go: [Modules in 5 Minutes](/modules5)
- **GopherCon** - I'm a chair of [Gophercon](https://gophercon.com), which is the largest [Go](https://golang.org) conference in the world.
- **Kubernetes SIG-Service-Catalog** - I am an emeritus chair of the Kubernetes [SIG-Service-Catalog](https://svc-cat.io/) group.

## My History

In my 15+ years in software engineering, I've worked in lots of different roles. Here are some of the thing I've done in them:

- I built a video aggregation system for capturing and publishing university lectures. We attached Mac Minis with webcams to carts and rolled them in and out of lecture halls.
- I was a C++ / Cocoa engineer at Microsoft on the Office for Mac team. We figured out how to run (and ship!) lots of the code from Windows Office on a Mac. I worked on the [Entourage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Entourage) product, which evolved into Outlook today
- I built a distributed log aggregation system with [Scribe](https://engineering.fb.com/data-infrastructure/scribe/). It transferred log data from edge locations and app servers, normalized it, and forwarded it to a data warehouse
- I wrote Newman, the first REST client library for Scala. It takes prior art from [Scalaz](https://github.com/scalaz/scalaz) and other functional programming concepts and presents them as a consistent API. The original codebase disappeared, but I forked it from a backup on [my GitHub organization](https://github.com/arschles/newman)
- I helped build an untrusted code execution platform on top of the JVM. It was similar to a modern "containers as a service" product, but just for JVM languages. We used several JVM features to constrain resources and provide jails
- I wrote one of the first Java APIs in the Scala language
- I designed an HTTP-based streaming RPC protocol and write a functional (as in functional programming) server implementation using the Twitter [Finagle](https://github.com/twitter/finagle) core primitives.
