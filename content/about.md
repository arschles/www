Hi there! I'm a [Gopher](https://golang.org), [Kubernaut](https://kubernetes.io) and functional programming nerd.

I also work at Microsoft as a [**C**loud **D**eveloper **A**dvocate](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/advocates/aaron-schlesinger) (CDA), where I focus there on Kubernetes / Containers, Go and emerging languages. I also [speak](/speaking) and [teach](/teaching) a wide variety of topics.

Here's what I'm up to these days:

##### The Ultimate Guide to Web Apps

I produce a subscription series called [The Ultimate Guide to Web Apps](https://gumroad.com/l/hgHhj). It dives deep into the world of building full-stack web apps with Go, and keeps you up to date in this fast-moving world.

I've also produced some other Go-related screencasts:

- [All about the Go html/template package](https://gum.co/gifm-x-14)
- [Dive deep into Go concurrency](https://gum.co/gifm-x-15)

##### Go in 5 Minutes

I produce **[Go in 5 Minutes](https://gifm.dev)**, a series of short screencasts with tutorials on Go.

##### Crystal Fridays

I produce **Crystal Fridays**, a weekly live-coding session where I write apps in [Crystal](https://crystal-lang.org)

>**Watch live every Friday at 10am US Pacific Time at [twitch.tv/arschles](https://twitch.tv/arschles)**

Recordings are [on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLd5PS0DQ17GBxMQ78nmowkAxilgS_LrNB)

##### GopherCon

I'm a chair of [Gophercon](https://gophercon.com), which is the largest [Go](https://golang.org) conference in the world.

I'm an emeritus chair of the Kubernetes 
[SIG-Service-Catalog](https://svc-cat.io/).

### My History

In my 15+ years in software engineering, I've worked in lots of different roles. Here are some of them:

- I helped build a video aggregation system for capturing and publishing university lectures. We attached Mac Minis with webcams to carts and rolled them in and out of lecture halls.
- I was a C++ / Cocoa engineer at Microsoft on the Office for Mac team. We figured out how to run (and ship!) lots of the code from Windows Office on a Mac
- I wrote [Newman](https://github.com/stackmob/newman), which was the first REST client library for Scala. It takes prior art from [Scalaz](https://github.com/scalaz/scalaz) and other "hardcore" functional programming concepts and presents them as a slick API. I wrote about it [here](https://www.paypal-engineering.com/2014/02/13/hello-newman-a-rest-client-for-scala/)
- I helped build an untrusted code execution platform on top of the JVM. It was a containers as a service product, but just for JVM languages. We used the JVM to constrain resources and provide jails.
