Welcome, Gopher! You might be here because you have questions about [Go modules](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules), or maybe you're just looking to find out more.

Either way, welcome! I hope that this page helps you learn about this brand-spankin-new dependency manager for Go.

>I'm also the creator of [Go in 5 Minutes](https://gifm.dev), which has been a really popular series because it's **quick**. I hope this article is the same!

## Who Am I, and What is This Place?

I'll make this quick, so you can get to the good stuff! Here's me in bullet points:

- Frequent hear-er of common questions about modules and how to use them
- [Cloud Developer Advocate](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/advocates/aaron-schlesinger) in the OSS group at Microsoft 
- Creator of [Go in 5 Minutes](https://gifm.dev), lots of experience teaching complicated things really quickly
- Go developer and teacher since ~2014

## ELI5: What Are Modules? ðŸ¤¨

**Modules are the dependency management system for Go apps.**

That's pretty much it! There have been other dependency managers out there prior to modules, but I'm gonna leave out the history here unless it's relevant to the present technology.

>If you're unfamiliar, `ELI5` stands for "explain like I'm 5" - I borrowed this acronym from the [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/)

## Beyond 5 Minutes: Where to Read More

I hope this document is enough to get you started and keep you going until you hit something really gnarly.

If/when you get there, check out the [wiki on modules](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules) to dive in to details. Things change from time to time with the underlying technology, and this wiki will be kept up to date as time goes on.
