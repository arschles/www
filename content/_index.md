title = "Hi There!"

I'm Aaron, an Azure **C**loud **D**eveloper **A**dvocate (CDA), specializing in [Go](https://golang.org), [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io), DevOps, and Emerging Languages.

Check out my fancy CDA profile [here](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/advocates/aaron-schlesinger).
    
# Technologies

I focus a ton of my time on [Athens](https://docs.gomods.io), Go dependency management, and building the Go community. I've spent a lot of time in the Kubernetes community as well, but I don't do as much there as I used to.

I also love trying out new programming languages like [Crystal](https://crystal-lang.org/), [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/) and [Ballerina](https://ballerina.io/).

Oh and I love to do stuff with functional programming but I'm not very good at it :)

# Teaching & Community

I've spent the past 5 years teaching (primarily Go) and building open source communities, most recently:

- [Go in 5 Minutes](https://goin5minutes.com) - a screencast series with the most concise, practical Go screencasts on the web
- [Go Study Groups](https://gophersource.com/study-group) - a casual meeting, similar to an unconference, for Gophers to chat about Go and meet other Gophers in the community

# Speaking

Aaron Schlesinger is a recognized public speaker and speaks primarily about Go, DevOps, and Kubernetes. He has recently spoken at notable industry leading conferences like:

- KubeCon

In the past, he's spoken on Scala, Java and technology transformation in large companies.

# Bio

Aaron is a developer advocate at Microsoft Azure and a core maintainer of the Athens Project. Before Athens, he was a core maintainer and chair of the Kubernetes SIG-Service-Catalog and a contributor to various other projects in the Kubernetes community.
