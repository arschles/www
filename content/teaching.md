I've spent the past 5 years teaching (primarily Go) and building open source communities. I currently run several programs to promote teaching Go to members of the community of all skill levels. The biggest of these programs is my [Go in 5 Minutes](https://goin5minutes.com) screencast.

I've also run internal workshops and spoken at internal corporate events on the Go and Scala programming languages, and DevOps best practices.
