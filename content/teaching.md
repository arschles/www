# Teaching & Community

I've spent the past 5 years teaching (primarily Go) and building open source communities. I currently run two programs to promote teaching Go to members of the community of all skill levels:

- [Go in 5 Minutes](https://goin5minutes.com) - a screencast series with the most concise, practical Go screencasts on the web.
- [Athens office hours](https://docs.gomods.io/contributing/community/office-hours/) - a series of gatherings of Athens community members new and old to ask and answer questions about the project, the code, the community, and eveything in between.
- [Go Study Groups](https://gophersource.com/study-group) - a casual meeting, similar to an unconference, for Gophers to chat about Go and meet other Gophers in the community. _I've transferred daily responsibilities for the Go Study Groups to the organizers of the [India chapter](https://www.meetup.com/Go-Study-Group-India/)._

I've also run internal workshops and spoken at internal corporate events on the Go and Scala programming languages, and DevOps best practices.
